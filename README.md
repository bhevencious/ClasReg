# ClasReg
 A unique multilayer framework simultaneously capable of Link Prediction and Breakup/Rift Prediction functionalities.

Basically, ClasReg is a Deep-Learning model whose framework essentially comprises a preprocessing layer, a representation/feature learning layer, a classification layer, a regression layer, and an inference/heuristic engine. ClasReg is a scalable model that exploits its multilayer framework for simultaneously resolving the problems of breakup/rift prediction as well as link prediction in social network structures.
