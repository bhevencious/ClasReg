# ClasReg
 A unique multilayer framework simultaneously capable of Link Prediction and Breakup/Rift Prediction functionalities.

Basically, ClasReg is a Deep-Learning model whose framework essentially comprises the following layers, viz:
(1) a Preprocessing layer;
(2) a Representation/Feature Learning layer;
(3) a Classification layer;
(4) a Regression layer; and
(5) an Inference/Heuristic engine.

Also, ClasReg is a scalable model that exploits its multilayer framework for simultaneously resolving the problems of breakup/rift prediction as well as link prediction in social network structures.
