# ClasReg: A Classification-Regression framework

# Introduction
A unique multilayer framework simultaneously capable of Link Prediction and Breakup/Rift Prediction functionalities.

Basically, ClasReg is a hybrid (Deep Learning and Heuristic methodologies) model whose framework essentially comprises the following layers, viz:
- a Preprocessing layer;
- a Representation/Feature Learning layer;
- a Classification layer;
- a Regression layer; and
- an Inference/Heuristic engine.

ClasReg, as a scalable and bifunctional framework, exploits its multilayer framework for simultaneously resolving the problems of Breakup/Rift Prediction as well as Link Prediction in social network structures.
