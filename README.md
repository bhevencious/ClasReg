# ClasReg
 A unique multilayer framework simultaneously capable of Link Prediction and Breakup/Rift Prediction functionalities.

Basically, ClasReg is a Deep-Learning model whose framework essentially comprises the following layers, viz:
1. a Preprocessing layer;
2. a Representation/Feature Learning layer;
3. a Classification layer;
4. a Regression layer; and
5. an Inference/Heuristic engine.

Also, ClasReg is a scalable model that exploits its multilayer framework for simultaneously resolving the problems of breakup/rift prediction as well as link prediction in social network structures.
