# ClasReg
 A unique multilayer framework simultaneously capable of Link Prediction and Breakup/Rift Prediction functionalities.

Basically, ClasReg is a Deep-Learning model whose framework essentially comprises the following layers, viz:
- a Preprocessing layer;
- a Representation/Feature Learning layer;
- a Classification layer;
- a Regression layer; and
- an Inference/Heuristic engine.

Also, ClasReg is a scalable model that exploits its multilayer framework for simultaneously resolving the problems of breakup/rift prediction as well as link prediction in social network structures.
